# nvim-config

This is simply my personal Neovim config.
I made this to make it super easy to sync configs between machines.

To use this config, simply run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/TacticalLaptopBag/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
This will clone this repo directly into `~/.config/nvim`.
